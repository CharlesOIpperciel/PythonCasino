# Python Casino üé∞  

A simple text-based **Blackjack** game built with Python. This game is no longer available on my Portfolio 2.0 as it's an older project.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:CharlesOIpperciel/PythonCasino.git
   ```
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:  
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the casino menu.  

## How to Play üÉè  

- Select **"Blackjack"** from the game menu.  
- Place your bet and start the hand.  
- Choose to **hit** or **stay** based on your cards.  
- Beat the dealer without exceeding **21** to win!
